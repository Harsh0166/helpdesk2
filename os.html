      <center><h1>Operating System</h1></center><br><br>

      <h3><b>Opreting system :- </b></h3>
      It is a callection of a programs that stablished the relationship between hardware adn user.  Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.

      The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computerâ€™s language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.
      ex :- Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Google's Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple iOS etc..
      
      
       <br><br>
       <h3>Advantages of O.S :-</h3>
       <ol type="i"></ol>
       <li><b>User Interface</b></li>
       <li><b>Progeam execution </b></li>
       <li><b>I/O opretion</b></li>
       <li><b>File-System Manipulation</b></li>
       <li><b>Comunication</b></li>
       <li><b>Error Detection </b></li>
       <li><b>Resourse allocations</b></li>
       <li><b>Accounting</b></li>
       <li><b>Protection & Secutity</b></li>
       <li><b>high CPU utilization</b></li>
        <li><b>increased throughout and efficient system use</b></li>
       <br> 
       <h3>Disadvantages of O.S :-</h3>There were many disadvantages of batch operating System : <br><br>
            <ol type="i">
              <li><strong>Limited Interactivity:</strong> Batch systems lack real-time user interaction during job processing.</li>
              <li><strong>Turnaround Time:</strong> Jobs in batch systems may have longer turnaround times, causing delays.</li>
              <li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> Suboptimal use of resources may occur due to fixed resource allocations.</li>
              <li><strong>Difficulty in Debugging:</strong> Identifying and fixing errors can be challenging, especially if they occur late in the batch.</li>
              <li><strong>Job Prioritization:</strong> Lack of dynamic job prioritization may lead to inefficiencies in task execution.</li>
            </ol> <br>
      <ol type="1">
        <h3><b>Types of O.S :-</b> </h3>
     
        <li><b>Uni-Programing </b><br>
          Opreting System only process to reside to in main memory . single process can not  keep CPU & I/O devices busy simutanesuly .  Uni-Programing means old O.S system only one program runs on the computer at a time . Either of the browser calculator or word processor runs at a time . </li>
          ex :- Bank Statment, Mobile phone etc...

          <br>
         
            <br><br>
          <li><b>Multiprogramming System</b></li>
          A multiprogramming system is one where many programs (application or user programs ) reside in the main memory at the same time. These application or users programs not only share the main memory but also CPU time and other system resources. Earliar these resides only a single program in memory and that single program was not able to make efficient use of systen in multiprogramming was developed so as to improve the CPU utilisation and make effiecient use of system. IN multiprogramming system, the memory is divided into several small portions. One portion of the memory holds the operating system and other portions of the memory holds different programs.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/Opreting System/batch.png" alt="" id="img1">
      <br>
    <br>
    <li><b>Time Sharing System / multi-tasking O.S </b></li>
    Both batch system and multiprogramming system worked in non-interactive environment, means the user of the system has no direct interaction with the system when the program is being executed. So there was a need for interactive computing environment so that user of the computer system can provide input with the help input devices and can see the output on the computer monitor. Time sharing system is the enhancement of multiprogramming system to provide this interactive user environment. TIme sharing is also multitasking system. In time sharing system two or more users are allowed to share the system. The users interact withe the system through their seperate monitor terminals. The user programs are stored in computer memory. The operating system assigns time interval called time-slice to each programs stored in memory associated with different users. The operating system uses CPU scheduling (CPU scheduling is decision making how to assign CPU time efficiently to different user programs stored in memory for execution) to switch the CPU time among different user programs.

    <br><br>
    <li><b>Real Time System</b></li>
    Real Time Systems are the systems designed to work in environment where processing is to be done within bounded time constraint otherwise there are several consequences and even system failure. Real-time systems are used in real-time applications or in embedded systems. Some examples of real time applications are : fire control system, nuclear plants control system, air defence system, industrial control system, nuclear plants control system, flight control system, modern automobile containing an embedded systems etc. Since real time systems are used to handle real time applications so the proper functioing of real time system is based on time bounded processing as well as correct result.
    ex- AI Traffic controllers,VxWorks etc..
    <br><br>
    <li><b>Multi-User   </b></li>
    This OS allows multiple numbers of users can access different resoures of a computer at a same time . The access is provided using a network that consists of varios personal computers attache to a personal computers system . It helps in the sharing of data informaton among diffrente users .
    <br><br>
    <img src="img/Opreting System/user.jpg" alt="" id="img1"> 
    <br><br<br> 
    <li><b>Multi-Processing </b></li>
    There is more than one proccessors present in the system which can execute more than one process at same time .  Multiple CPUs are linked together so that a job can be divided and executed more quickly. When a job is completed, the results from all CPUs are compiled to provide the final output.
    ex :- Symmetric , Asymmetrics

    <h3><b> Process And Process States transition Diagram :-</b></h3>
    <br>
    <h6>Process =>  A process is a program in execution which then forms the basis of all computation. The process is not as same as program code but a lot more than it. A process is an 'active' entity as opposed to the program which is considered to be a 'passive' entity. </h6> <br> 
    <h6><b>Process State transition Diagram :- </b></h6><br>
    <img src="img/Opreting System/states .jpg" alt=""id="img1"> <br>
    <h6>A process has several stages that it passes through from beginning to end. There must be a minimum of five states. Even though during execution, the process could be in one of these states, the names of the states are not standardized. Each process goes through several stages throughout its life cycle.
      <br><br>

      Process States in Operating System
      The states of a process are as follows: 
      <br><br>
      New (Create): In this step, the process is about to be created but not yet created. It is the program that is present in secondary memory that will be picked up by OS to create the process.
      <br><br>
      Ready: New -> Ready to run. After the creation of a process, the process enters the ready state i.e. the process is loaded into the main memory. The process here is ready to run and is waiting to get the CPU time for its execution. Processes that are ready for execution by the CPU are maintained in a queue called ready queue for ready processes.
      <br><br>
      Run: The process is chosen from the ready queue by the CPU for execution and the instructions within the process are executed by any one of the available CPU cores.
      <br><br>
      Blocked or Wait: Whenever the process requests access to I/O or needs input from the user or needs access to a critical region(the lock for which is already acquired) it enters the blocked or waits state. The process continues to wait in the main memory and does not require CPU. Once the I/O operation is completed the process goes to the ready state.
      <br><br>
      Terminated or Completed: Process is killed as well as PCB is deleted. The resources allocated to the process will be released or deallocated.
      <br><br>
      Suspend Ready: Process that was initially in the ready state but was swapped out of main memory(refer to Virtual Memory topic) and placed onto external storage by the scheduler is said to be in suspend ready state. The process will transition back to a ready state whenever the process is again brought onto the main memory.
      <br><br>
      Suspend wait or suspend blocked: Similar to suspend ready but uses the process which was performing I/O operation and lack of main memory caused them to move to secondary memory. When work is finished it may go to suspend ready.</h6> <br>
      <h6><b>How does a process move between different states in an operating system</b></h6>
      <br>
      <h6>New to ready: When a process is created, it is in a new state. It moves to the ready state when the operating system has allocated resources to it and it is ready to be executed.
        <br><br> 
        Ready to running: When the CPU becomes available, the operating system selects a process from the ready queue depending on various scheduling algorithms and moves it to the running state.
        <br><br>
        Running to blocked: When a process needs to wait for an event to occur (I/O operation or system call), it moves to the blocked state. For example, if a process needs to wait for user input, it moves to the blocked state until the user provides the input.
        <br><br>
        Running to ready: When a running process is preempted by the operating system, it moves to the ready state. For example, if a higher-priority process becomes ready, the operating system may preempt the running process and move it to the ready state.
        <br><br>
        Blocked to ready: When the event a blocked process was waiting for occurs, the process moves to the ready state. For example, if a process was waiting for user input and the input is provided, it moves to the ready state.
        <br><br>
        Running to terminated: When a process completes its execution or is terminated by the operating system, it moves to the terminated state.</h6>
        <br><br><br> 
        <h3><b> Proces Control Block ( PCB ) :- </b></h3>
        In an operating system, a Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure that contains information about a process, including its current state, program counter, CPU registers, and other relevant information. PCBs are used by the operating system to manage and control processes, including scheduling, resource allocation, and communication between processes. Each process in the system has its own PCB, which is created and maintained by the operating system. <br> 
        <img src="img/Opreting System/PCB.jpg" alt=""id="img1"> <br> 
        Pointer: It is a stack pointer that is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process. <br><br>
Process state: It stores the respective state of the process.<br><br>
Process number: Every process is assigned a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.<br><br>
Program counter: It stores the counter,: which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.<br><br>
Register: These are the CPU registers which include the accumulator, base, registers, and general-purpose registers.<br><br>
Memory limits: This field contains the information about memory management system used by the operating system. This may include page tables, segment tables, etc.<br><br>
Open files list : This information includes the list of files opened for a process.
